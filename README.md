# Jurua Arboviruses Project: Jurua River, Amazonas, Brazil

This repository will contain the .csv files with the DNA and RNA sequencing data, and the R scripts used to analyze the sequencing data for the manuscripts related to the Jurua Arbovirus Project.

The data collection for this project was carried out during the dry-to-wet transition seasons in 2021 and 2022 in the central Amazon Basin along the Jurua River near Carauari. This work was the focus of an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Biology (awarded to A. Massey) with logistical and field support provided by the Instituto Jurua based in Carauari, Brazil. We trapped mosquitos along a gradient of increasing urbanization and across a variety of land-use types (urban, periurban, river community, cropland, interior forest). Female mosquitos were sorted by site, date, and land-use type and then molecularly processed for DNA metabarcoding and RNA sequencing.
